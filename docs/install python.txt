You need to install python, and also it's numerical python (numpy) and plotting (matplotlib) libraries.

The easiest way for most people to do this is to install the enthought python edition, which includes all the required libraries. It is free if you are affiliated with an academic institution, or for a trial version. 
You can download it from http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php

There is also a new free version, that is totally free for everyone, which is more than enough.
So if you dont want the full package, folow this link...

Otherwise you can install the main python and the libraries seperately, as described below.
