TO DO

automatically produce histogram-distribution figure after multi-runs 

extra column in outputs for undiscounted profit (for clarity)

an extra input file for users to specify disallowed combinations of landuses... eg. canola-canolaX

give overall profit as an average per year? (accounting for discounting?) ie annualised NPV

'water effects' over multiple years - and varying by affected crop as well as affecting crop - specified in a seperate parameter file...
this will be flexible enough to allow any kind of additional effect over time as far as I can see (including soil health, factor X, or fairy dust)
Like this:
fallow,wheat, 1, 1.2 
fallow,canola, 1, 1.3 
fallow,canola, 2, 1.1 



price variability (independent of season or linked to season)

variable costs as a function of yield - do this as a linear function? ie fixed variable cost plus extra variable cost per tonne of yield? 


TO DO MAYBE

broad-leaf weed as well as grass weed? this wouldnt be a big hassle to do, but will complicate model parametrisation?? 
although i can again think of a way to put it in a seperate file and allow simple defaults to minimise complexity...


POSSIBLE BUT NOT NOW

N effects over multiple years - wait for improved mechanistic N module (or include as water effect)

add a 'soil health' module?? probably not
















change final weed seed penalty to be a maximum weed seed number instead...

make a max number for each land use option...
